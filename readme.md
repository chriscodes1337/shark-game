# AI Game
## Instructions
### How to play
Hit "Play" and use the arrow keys (or arrow buttons on touchscreen devices) to control the character.<br>
A pretrained AI is loaded when you first load or refresh the page.<br>
Let the AI play a few times by using the "Let AI play" button and compare scores.<br>
### How to train a new neural network (not available on mobile/touchscreen devices)
While you play, an array is filled with recorded data of your arrow key presses in your browser (only locally on your machine).<br>
You can then train a new AI model based on your inputs by using the "Train new net" button.<br>
The AI will now play just like you!

## Additional info
The arrow buttons on touchscreen devices do not work properly in this version.<br>
The pretrained AI has been trained on a ton of human inputs.<br>
Using the pretrained base model that loads when you first load or refresh the page may give you the best results,<br>
but maybe you can train a better AI!<br>
Training can take a while depending on your hardware and the amount of data you have recorded (or may not work on older hardware).
